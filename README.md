# SimpleRecorder

## statement

SimpleRecorder is a simple SuperCollider class providing an audio signal recorder, both programmable and with a small GUI front-end. It has been lying around for years, but since I have been asked for it a few times, I thought it might be useful to put this into an official upload.

## requirements / installation

Put the `.sc` class file in your SuperCollider extensions folder (`Platform.userExtensionDir`). In place of a help file, there is an `.scd` file that serves as a quick references of the functionality.

The class has been tested with SC 3.5 and 3.6.3. It should probably work with much older versions, too.

## future ideas

 - Folder selection should be in the GUI
 - A meter and headroom display should be in the GUI
