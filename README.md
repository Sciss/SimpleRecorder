## SimpleRecorder

### statement

SimpleRecorder is a simple SuperCollider class providing an audio signal recorder, both programmable and with a small GUI front-end. It has been lying around for years, but since I have been asked for it a few times, I thought it might be useful to put this into an official upload.

### requirements / installation

Put the `.sc` class file in your SuperCollider extensions folder. Sorry, I dislike the new help format (mostly because it costs you a lot of work to write a simple thing), thus there is no properly formatted help file. The `.scd` file serves as a quick references of the functionality, though.

The class has just been cleaned up a bit and tested with SC 3.5. It should probably work with much older versions, too.

### future ideas

 - Folder selection should be in the GUI
 - A meter and headroom display should be in the GUI
